# AI & Machine Learning Basics Quiz

### Q1. What does “AI” stand for?

- [x] Artificial Intelligence
- [ ] Automated Integration
- [ ] Applied Innovation
- [ ] Algorithmic Index

**Explanation:** AI refers to machines designed to mimic human intelligence.

### Q2. Which of the following is an example of supervised learning?

- [ ] K-Means Clustering
- [x] Linear Regression
- [ ] Principal Component Analysis
- [ ] DBSCAN

**Explanation:** Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm because it learns from labeled data.

### Q3. What is overfitting in machine learning?

- [ ] When the model is too simple
- [x] When the model performs well on training data but poorly on new data
- [ ] When the data is corrupted
- [ ] When the algorithm runs too slowly

**Explanation:** Overfitting occurs when the model learns noise from the training data instead of general patterns.

### Q4. Which of these is a common activation function in neural networks?

- [ ] Mean Squared Error
- [ ] Gradient Descent
- [x] ReLU
- [ ] Random Forest

**Explanation:** ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is widely used in neural networks as an activation function.

### Q5. What is the difference between AI and ML?

- [x] ML is a subset of AI focused on learning from data
- [ ] AI is a subset of ML
- [ ] AI and ML are the same
- [ ] ML refers to hardware, AI to software

I'll analyze the existing quiz and provide two additional questions while maintaining the same format:

### Q6. What is Deep Learning?
- [x] A subset of machine learning using neural networks with multiple layers
- [ ] A type of database management system
- [ ] A programming language for AI
- [ ] A method of storing large datasets

**Explanation:** Deep Learning is a specialized subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple (deep) layers to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input. It's particularly powerful for complex tasks like image and speech recognition.

### Q7. Which of these is NOT a common type of machine learning?
- [ ] Supervised Learning
- [ ] Unsupervised Learning
- [ ] Reinforcement Learning
- [x] Perpetual Learning

**Explanation:** While Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning are the three main types of machine learning, "Perpetual Learning" is not a standard classification. The main categories are:
- Supervised Learning (learns from labeled data)
- Unsupervised Learning (finds patterns in unlabeled data)
- Reinforcement Learning (learns through trial and error with rewards/penalties)
