```rust
...
let s = String::form("hello");
let slice = &s[0..2];
```

- [ ] let slice = &s[len + 2];
- [ ] let slice = &s[len - 2];
- [ ] let slice = &s.copy(0..2);
- [x] let slice = &s[..2];

#### Q23. Why does this code _not_ compile?

```rust

}
```

- [ ] Closures are types, so they cannot be returned directly from a function.
- [ ] Closures are types and can be returned only if the concrete trait is implemented.
- [x] Closures are represented by traits, so they cannot be a return type.
