- [ ] Encrypt data before transmission
- [x] Monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic
- [ ] Provide physical security for servers
- [ ] Manage user access to applications

**Explanation**

- A firewall is a network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules.

**Explanation**

- Phishing is a type of cyber attack where attackers trick individuals into providing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, or financial details by pretending to be legitimate entities.

This could involve impersonating a trusted authority figure, creating a sense of urgency, or exploiting the victim's emotions. The other options (encryption, firewalling, and patching) are security measures, not social engineering techniques.

#### Q177. What is the primary purpose of a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system?

- [ ] To encrypt sensitive data
- [ ] To manage user passwords
- [x] To collect, analyze, and respond to security events
- [ ] To block all incoming network traffic

**Explanation:**
A Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system is a security solution that collects, analyzes, and correlates security-related data from various sources within an organization. The primary purpose of a SIEM is to provide a centralized view of an organization's security posture, detect and respond to security incidents, and generate reports for compliance and auditing purposes. It is not primarily used for encryption, password management, or blocking all network traffic.
