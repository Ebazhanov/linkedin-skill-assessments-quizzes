#### Q2. How is a forEach statement different from a for statement?

- [ ] Only a for statement uses a callback function.
- [x] A for statement is more generic and can be used with various iterable objects, while a forEach statement is mainly designed for arrays but can also be used with other iterable objects like Sets.
- [ ] Only a forEach statement lets you specify your own iterator.
- [ ] A forEach statement is generic, but a for statement can be used only with an array.

#### Q12. You need to match a time value such as 12:00:32. Which of the following regular expressions would work for your code?

- [ ] `/[0-9]{2,}:[0-9]{2,}:[0-9]{2,}/`
- [x] `/\d\d:\d\d:\d\d/`
- [ ] `/[0-9]+:[0-9]+:[0-9]+/`
- [ ] `/ : : /`

**NOTE**: The first three are all partially correct and will match digits, but the **second option is the most correct** because it will **only** match **2 digit** time values (12:00:32). The first option would have worked if the repetitions range looked like `[0-9]{2}`, however because of the **comma** `[0-9]{2,}` it will select 2 **or more** digits (120:000:321). The third option will any range of time digits, single _and_ multiple (meaning `1:2:3` will also match).

#### Q35. Why is it usually better to work with Objects instead of Arrays to store a collection of records?

- [ ] Objects are more efficient in terms of storage.

- [ ] Working with objects makes the code more readable.

[Reference efficiency of lookups](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17295056/array-vs-object-efficiency-in-javascript)
**Explanation:** Records in an object can be retrieved using their key which can be any given value (e.g. an employee ID, a city name, etc), whereas to retrieve a record from an array we need to know its index.

#### Q58. Why might you choose to make your code asynchronous?

- [x] to start tasks that might take some time without blocking subsequent tasks from executing immediately
- [ ] to ensure that tasks further down in your code are not initiated until earlier tasks have completed
- [ ] to make your code faster
- [ ] to ensure that the call stack maintains a LIFO (Last in, First Out) structure

**EXPLANATION:** `"to ensure that tasks further down in your code are not initiated until earlier tasks have completed" you use the normal (synchronous) flow where each command is executed sequentially. Asynchronous code allows you to break this sequence: start a long running function (AJAX call to an external service) and continue running the rest of the code in parallel.`
