> **Explanation:**  
> In all modern C standards, parameter names in a function declaration are optional.  
> However, the meaning of an empty parameter list (`int f();`) differs by standard:
>
> - **Before C23:** Declares a function with an unspecified number of parameters (not a prototype).
> - **In C23:** Equivalent to `int f(void);` — declares a function that takes no parameters.

#### Q76. What does the following declaration mean?

```
int (*ptr)[10];
```

- [x] ptr is a pointer to an array of 10 integers
- [ ] ptr is an array of 10 integers

#### Q77. What will be the output of the following code snippet?

```c
#include <stdio.h>
void change(int,int);
int main()
{
   int a=10,b=20;
   change(a,b); //calling a function by passing the values of variables.
   printf("Value of a is: %d",a);
   printf("\n");
   printf("Value of b is: %d",b);
   return 0;
}
void change(int x,int y)
{
   x=13;
   y=17;
}
```

- [x] 10,20
- [ ] 10,10
- [ ] 20,20
- [ ] 20,10

**Explanation:** The function "change" will change the value of x and y only within its own scope, so a and is unaffected.

#### Q78. Choose true or false. When a variable is created in C, a memory address is assigned to the variable.

- [x] True
- [ ] False

#### Q79. What does the following fragment of C-program print?

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    char c[] = "GATE2011";

    char *p = c;

    printf("%s", p + p[3] -p[1]);

    return 0;
}
```

- [ ] GATE 2011
- [ ] E2011
- [x] 2011
- [ ] 01

**Explanation:** char c[ ] = "GATE2011"; since char \*p =c it means p represents the base address of string “GATE2011” SO p[3] is 'E' and p[1] is 'A'. Value of Sub expression p[3] – p[1] = ASCII value of ‘E’ – ASCII value of ‘A’ = 4. So the expression p + p[3] – p[1] becomes ( p + 4) And (p+4) represent to base address of string “2011” printf(“%s”, p + p[3] – p[1]) ; So it will print 2011

#### Q80. What is the output of the following code snippet?

```c
int main() {
	int a = 5, b = 6, c;
	c = a++ + ++b;
	printf("%d %d %d", a, b, c);
	return 0;
}
```

- [ ] 5 6 11
- [x] 6 7 12
- [ ] 5 6 12
- [ ] 6 6 12

case 'B' :
	printf ("choice B ") ;
case 'C' :
case 'D' :
case 'E' :
default:

}

```

- [ ] No choice
- [ ] Choice A
- [x] Choice A
      Choice B No choice
- [ ] Program gives no output as it is erroneous

- [x] :

```c
struct a {
    void (*f1)();

- [x] strstr(str1, str2);
- [ ] substring(str1, str2);
- [ ] strspn(str1, str2);

#### Q86. How are static functions different from global functions?

- [ ] Static functions must be declared in advance of being defined.
- [ ] Static functions must be declared in a separate header file.
- [ ] Static functions always return the same value.
- [x] Static functions can be accessed only in the file where they are declared.

#### Q87. What does this program display?

```c
main(){
    char *p = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
    int i;
    for (i=0;i<5;i++) *p++; *p++;
    printf("%c",*p++);
}
```

- [ ] K
- [ ] M
- [ ] H
- [x] G

#### Q88. What is not a valid command with this declaration?
