#### Q71. What is the difference between managed and unmanaged code?

- [x] Managed code is code that is handled by the common language runtime (CLR). Unmanaged code is any code that does not depend on CLR for execution.

- [ ] Decorator
- [ ] Bridge

#### Q74. What is IL?

- [x] an object-oriented programming language that is a partially compiled code that .NET developers will then compile to native machine code
- [ ] a programming language methodology that enables developers to change data using a succinct yet expressive syntax by instilling Microsoft .NET-based languages with the capability to make queries
- [ ] a programming language that .NET developers use, and that represents the lowest possible level for a language that humans can still read
- [ ] a programming language that .NET developers cannot use, and that represents the lowest possible level for a language that humans cannot read

#### Q75. What is the difference between covariance and contravariance?

- [ ] In C#, covariance and contravariance disable implicit reference conversion for array types, delegate types, and generic type arguments. Contravariance preserves assignment compatibility and covariance reverses it.
