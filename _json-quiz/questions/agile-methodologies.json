In a flow-based system, priorities are updated continuously to provide the best economic outcomes. Job sequencing, rather than individual job return on investment, produces the best result. To that end, WSJF is used to prioritize backlogs by calculating the relative CoD and job size (a proxy for the duration).`\r\n[(Source)](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/wsjf/)\r\n\r\n"
