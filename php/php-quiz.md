`echo 76 <=> '76 trombones';`

- [ ] 1
- [ ] -1
- [ ] a parser error
- [x] 0

$arrlength = count($numbers);
for($x = 0; $x < $arrlength; $x++){

    echo "<br />";
    }
```

- [ ] This does not meet all the criteria because the resulting numbers will be "2461122", which is in no particular order.
- [ ] This meets the criteria because the <br /> is present and sort() lists in descending order
- [x] This does not meet all the criteria because the sort() function sorts an indexed array in ascending order. Thus this code will display "2 4 6 11 22" shown vertically, but the numbers are spaced.
