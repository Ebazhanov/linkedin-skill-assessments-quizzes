Cloud Storage is designed specifically for storing unstructured data, such as images, videos, and backups. It is highly scalable, durable, and optimized for performance. Cloud Spanner is a fully managed, scalable, relational database service for mission-critical applications requiring strong consistency and horizontal scaling. It’s not designed for unstructured data storage.
