`The contenteditable global attribute is an enumerated attribute indicating if the element should be editable by the user. If so, the browser modifies its widget to allow editing.

- [ ] `<input type="text" hidden name="important" value="information">`

`<input> elements of type hidden let web developers include data that cannot be seen or modified by users when a form is submitted. For example, the ID of the content that is currently being ordered or edited, or a unique security token. Hidden inputs are completely invisible in the rendered page, and there is no way to make it visible in the page's content.` [Source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/hidden)

#### Q101. What is the semantic way to add an identifying title to a table?

  alt="Our favorite image"

/>
```

- [ ] small.jpg
- [ ] medium.jpg
- [ ] none of them
- [x] large.jpg

`The browser will: 1. Look at its device width. 2. Work out which media condition in the sizes list is the first one to be true. 3. Look at the slot size given to that media query. 4. Load the image referenced in the srcset list that has the same size as the slot or, if there isn't one, the first image that is bigger than the chosen slot size.` [Source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images)
